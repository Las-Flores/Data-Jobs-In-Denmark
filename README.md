## üåü Highlights
- Analysing the job market in Denmark.
- Helpful for anyone that considers or already works with data in Denmark.
- Tech stack: Octoparse (web scraping) & Python (pandas, (matplotlib, seaborn)) & Power BI 


## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Overview

This project was made primarily for myself, but can easily be used by anyone else. My findings show among others what skills are in demand, what industries the jobs belong in and what are the most popular locations for jobs in data. My dataset is made by myself by web scraping linkedin job listings with Octoparse after searching "data" and setting the location to entire Denmark to make sure I collect all jobs that have a connection with data. I cleaned and preprocessed the data and did some simple EDA in jupyter notebook. I then made a power BI dashboard to make it more accesible to look at and interact with my now cleaned and organized dataset. 


### ‚úçÔ∏è Author

My name's Alan and at the time of finishing this project I'm still in the second year of my 3 year highschool. I'm just doing simple data science to hopefully get a nice head start in the field and I actually enjoy doing it. Also it's a nice distraction LMAO.


## üöÄ Usage

It would be best if you could install both the jupyter notebook and power BI, since you can't see the power BI dashboard in github and the notebook is not fully working. 


This is also a great place to invite others to contribute in any ways that make sense for your project. Point people to your DEVELOPMENT and/or CONTRIBUTING guides if you have them.
